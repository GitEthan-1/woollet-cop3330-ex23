/**
 * Exercise 23 - Troubleshooting Car Issues
 * An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to perform a task that a human expert might do.
 * Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical issue by answering a series of questions.
 * And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to help people solve simple technical issues before calling a human.
 *
 * Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car. Use the following decision tree to build the system:
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
 * Are the battery terminals corroded? n
 * The battery cables may be damaged.
 * Replace cables and try again.
 *
 * Constraint
 *
 * Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers. Donâ€™t ask for all inputs at once.
 *
 * Challenge
 *
 * Investigate rules engines and inference engines. These are powerful ways to solve complex problems that are based on rules and facts.
 * Identify a rules engine for your programming language and use it to solve this problem
